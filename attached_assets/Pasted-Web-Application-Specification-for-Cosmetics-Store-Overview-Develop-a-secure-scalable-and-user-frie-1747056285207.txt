Web Application Specification for Cosmetics Store
Overview
Develop a secure, scalable, and user-friendly web application for a cosmetics store. The application must support product browsing, detailed product descriptions, dynamic freight calculations, a robust admin dashboard, and integrations with marketplaces and payment gateways.
Functional Requirements
1. Frontend (Customer-Facing)

Technology Stack: Use React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
Product Categories:
Display products organized by categories (e.g., Skincare, Makeup, Haircare).
Include a search bar and filters (e.g., price, brand, category).


Product Description Page:
Display detailed information: product name, description, weight, quantity, ingredients, usage instructions, price, and stock status.
Include high-quality images with zoom functionality.
Enable customer reviews and ratings (authenticated users only).
Provide an "Add to Cart" and "Add to Wishlist" feature.


Freight Calculation:
Integrate a real-time freight calculation tool on the product page.
Use a third-party API (e.g., Correios or Shippo) to calculate shipping costs based on postal code and product weight.
Cache results using Redis for performance.


Cart and Checkout:
Allow users to view and edit cart contents.
Integrate a secure checkout process with a payment gateway (see Integrations).
Send order confirmation emails using a service like SendGrid.



2. Admin Dashboard

Technology Stack: Use React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend.
Features:
User Management: Register, edit, and delete customer accounts (admin-only).
Product Management:
Add, edit, or remove products with fields for name, description, weight, quantity, price, category, images, and stock.
Reflect changes in real-time on the customer-facing site (e.g., show/hide products).


Order Management:
View, update, and cancel orders.
Display order details (customer info, products, shipping address, status).


Analytics: Show basic metrics (e.g., total sales, popular products).


Access Control:
Restrict dashboard access to authenticated admins using JWT-based authentication.
Implement role-based authorization (admin vs. customer).



3. Backend

Technology Stack: Use Node.js with Express and MongoDB for the database.
APIs:
RESTful APIs for product, order, and user management.
Secure endpoints with JWT and rate limiting (e.g., using express-rate-limit).


Database Schema:
Products: name, description, weight, quantity, price, category, images, stock.
Orders: customer ID, products, total price, shipping address, status, timestamp.
Users: email, password (hashed), role (admin/customer), address.


Security:
Use bcrypt for password hashing.
Sanitize inputs using a library like express-validator.
Enable CORS only for trusted domains.
Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys) in environment variables.



4. Integrations

Marketplaces:
Integrate with at least two marketplaces (e.g., Amazon, Shopee) via their APIs.
Sync product listings and orders between the web app and marketplaces.
Use webhooks for real-time updates.


Payment Gateway:
Integrate PerfectPay or an alternative (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
Support credit/debit cards, boleto, and Pix (for Brazil).
Ensure PCI DSS compliance for payment processing.


Shipping API:
Use a shipping API (e.g., Correios, Shippo) for freight calculations.
Validate postal codes and handle API errors gracefully.



5. Security Requirements

Use HTTPS for all communications.
Implement CSRF protection for forms.
Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS and SQL injection.
Comply with GDPR/CCPA for user data (e.g., consent for cookies, data deletion requests).
Regularly back up the database and store backups securely.
Use a WAF (e.g., Cloudflare) to protect against DDoS attacks.

6. Performance and Scalability

Host the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Vercel).
Use a CDN (e.g., Cloudflare) for static assets.
Implement lazy loading for images and infinite scroll for product lists.
Optimize database queries with indexes.
Use a caching layer (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.

Non-Functional Requirements

Accessibility: Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance (e.g., alt text for images, keyboard navigation).
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Support Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
Responsive Design: Optimize for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Uptime: Target 99.9% uptime with monitoring (e.g., New Relic).

Deliverables

Source code hosted in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
API documentation using Swagger/Postman.
Deployment instructions for the chosen cloud platform.
Unit tests for critical backend APIs (e.g., using Jest).

Timeline

Phase 1 (2 weeks): Design and setup (frontend, backend, database).
Phase 2 (3 weeks): Implement core features (product pages, dashboard, freight calculation).
Phase 3 (2 weeks): Integrations (marketplaces, payment, shipping).
Phase 4 (1 week): Testing, security audit, and deployment.
